## Moving Vercel Logo
- http://creative-exercise-colinnguyen-5-git-main-colinnguyen5s-projects.vercel.app
- I chose to do an animated SVG. Myy code is based off of these 2 links: https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_scripting.asp , https://www.svgator.com/help/getting-started/add-animated-svgs-to-react-website
- I took the idea of having a start and stop button from the website to make an animated SVG that moves left to right. Instead of the circle that is moving, I took the Vercel Logo from Next.Js base template and made it move using the two buttons.
- A user can press on the start button to move the Vercel Logo and the stop button will stop it from moving. After the logo has reach it's maximum position of the page, it will reset back to the left.
